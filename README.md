Provides simple UI to the StackOverflow website, which enables you to give a quick explanation on why you downvoted the question. **This user-script was made possible by the great [idownvotedbecau.se](https://idownvotedbecau.se/) website from [Will Sullivan](https://github.com/WillSullivan).**

## About

The extension will display a popup every time you are trying to downvote a question. After you choose from an option, a pre-constructed will get posted with a basic explanation on why you downvoted. It will also include a link to the [idownvotedbecau.se](https://idownvotedbecau.se/) website with more information on the problem.

This could result in a message similar to this one:

_I downvoted, because it seems like that [no or less effort in debugging the code](https://idownvotedbecau.se/nodebugging/) was made._

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager; these are free extensions available for all popular browsers that allow you to manage and install userscripts. I'd recommend using [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) for Chromium and Firefox based browsers.

2. Install the userscript by clicking the install link below. 

   <kbd>[install](https://github.com/TwentyFourMinutes/IDownvotedBecauseEx/blob/master/src/core.js)</kbd>

3. Now the next time you will click the downvote button, the pop up shown above will appear.
